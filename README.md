# OllamaChat Mod (Fabric)

Empower Minecraft players to interact with locally deployed AI models through in-game commands! Built on [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), this mod enables dynamic AI-generated conversations.

Thank [DeepSeek Chat](https://chat.deepseek.com/) for helping me solve various problems and writing most of the network communication code and other code.
